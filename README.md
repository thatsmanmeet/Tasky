# ⚠️ Development Update

Tasky is reaching EOL soon and hence I'm dropping all the issues & pull requests on github as not planned. The app **may** receive dependencies, security updates and bug fixes only with exception of feature updates **very rarely**, so you can continue to keep using the app for little longer. Remaining updates will arrive only on PlayStore and Github, while other stores are no longer supported for remaining updates.
